# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome and appreciate contributions to our Unity modules! To help ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

## 1. Reporting Issues

- If you find a bug or have a feature request, please check if it has already been reported in the [issues](https://github.com/UModules/REPO_NAME/issues) section.
- If not, feel free to open a new issue. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue if it's a bug.

## 2. Forking the Repository

To contribute code:
1. Fork the repository by clicking the **Fork** button at the top right of the project page.
2. Clone your forked repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

## 3. Making Changes
- Make your changes in a separate branch from `main`. Use descriptive names for your branches (e.g., `feature/add-new-ui-component` or `bugfix/fix-null-exception`).
- Ensure that your code follows the style and architecture of the existing project.
- If possible, write unit tests for any new functionality to ensure its correctness.

## 4. Submitting a Pull Request
When your changes are ready:
1. Push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin BRANCH_NAME
```
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) on the original repository.
3. In the PR description, clearly explain the changes you made and why they are necessary.
4. Ensure all tests pass, and address any feedback from reviewers.

## 5. Code Review
- Your pull request will be reviewed by one of the maintainers.
- If changes are requested, update your PR accordingly and mention that it's ready for review again.

## 6. Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UModules/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please be respectful and collaborative.

Thank you for your contributions!
